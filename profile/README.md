# TibHome - Personal Homelab Project

Welcome to **TibHome**, a personal homelab project where I share various tools and scripts to make your homelab setup easier and more efficient. I believe in the power of open-source software, and that's why I make all of my code publicly available. These tools are designed to help with monitoring, automation, and management of various aspects of your homelab environment.

## Introduction

TibHome is a growing collection of tools and utilities that I’ve developed for managing my personal homelab. The goal is to make it easier for others to set up and maintain their homelabs with open-source, accessible, and simple-to-use solutions. Over time, more tools will be added, and the project will continue to evolve to meet the needs of homelab enthusiasts everywhere.

## Current Tools

- **xfce-novnc**

- **bash-netalerte**

## Future Tools

I’m continuously working on new tools for TibHome, and here are some that will be coming soon:

- **Backup Automation Tool**
- **System Health Monitor**
- **Power Management Tool**

Stay tuned for updates as more tools are added.
